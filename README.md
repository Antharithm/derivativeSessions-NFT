Derivative Sessions is a music platform that can be rewarding to both creators and fans who use the decentralized app. Creators can upload their music and artwork to IPFS and through our front end and fans will be allowed to stream their favorite Derivative music. Creators will gain streaming “Derivative Tokens” every time one of their songs or artwork is clicked on by a fan. Fans who stream the content also get rewarded for their time spent enjoying the library of material. More Derivative “musicians” can be minted when the community agrees on a qualified musical candidate. All Derivative musicians, in real life, are represented by their NFTs on the platform. There needs to be a premine of musicians who can supply years worth of material liquidity on the dApp.
